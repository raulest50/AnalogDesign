<p>
 For a fixed value of Vds, Id is plotted against variations of Vgs. It can be seen that conduction happens after Vtn (threshold voltage).
 Once Vtn is reached, small variations on Vgs can make big variations on Id and Vds, similar to what happens with a diode and bjt transistor.
 This can be helpfull for voltage regulation.
